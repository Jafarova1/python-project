# Who Wants to Be a Millionaire

## Project Purpose
This project automatically generates multiple-choice quizzes. Questions can cover various topics or focus on a specific subject, like movies, using data from domain-specific sources (e.g., IMDb). Each quiz has one question and four possible answers, with only one correct answer. The program also adjusts answer choices based on the desired difficulty and tracks the player's performance with a score reflecting question difficulty.

## Libraries
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn (optional for visualization)
- Cinemagoer (for IMDb API)
